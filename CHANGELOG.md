- The width and height of each axes can be set using `mpl_ascii.AXES_WIDTH` and `mpl_ascii.AXES_HEIGHT`. It defaults to 150 characters in width and 40 characters in height.

## [0.1.0] - 2024-04-25

### Added

When using the `mpl_ascii` backend then `plt.show()` will print the plot as a string consisting of basic ASCII characters. This is supported for:

    - Bar charts
    - Horizontal bar charts
    - Line plots
    - Scatter plots

You can also save figures as a text file. You can do this by using the savefig `figure.savefig("my_figure.txt")` and this will save the ASCII plot as a txt file.
